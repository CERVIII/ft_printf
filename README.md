# ft_printf

The `ft_printf` project of 42 school.

## Description

This project involves replicating the `printf` function from the C standard library. The `printf` function is used to print formatted text to the standard output (e.g., the console). The goal of this project is to better understand the internal workings of this function and to improve programming skills in C.

## Installation

To compile the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/CERVIII/ft_printf.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd ft_printf
   ```
3. Compile the project:
   ```sh
   make
   ```

## Usage

To use the `ft_printf` function in your project, include the header file and call the function as shown below:

```c
#include "ft_printf.h"

int main() {
    ft_printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}
```
